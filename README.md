ZOO Cart
========

ZOO Cart is basic shopping cart element for ZOO CCK by YooTheme using SimpleCart js

The files in this repositiory assume you are running Joomla! 2.5 and using YOO Nano 2 Theme. The files should work for any recent version of Joomla!, ZOO and any template. The ZOO Cart works really well so far, but some things like product variant 'selectors' need a lot of work. I'm hoping the community at large can help with this.

Peace, love and code.
